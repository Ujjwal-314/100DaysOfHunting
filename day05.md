# Start of the day

Its fresh 18 apr, feeling great this morning. Woke up at 6:30 with 5 hours of sleep, slept this much because I procrastinated last night a bit.
By the way, Started this day with watching, DEF CON 32 - [The Darkest side of bug bounty by jason haddix](https://youtu.be/6SNy0u6pYOc?si=5Q-9-MM2oGMkPLa4)

And from today for around a week, i may have to study for my high school exams, will also document that here.

## Learning from that video

### criticality
- pre-provide CVSS 4.0 justification
- Reference possible compliance they are subject to
- Write out impact scenarios well
- Take help of AI if you need to 

### farming
- Stagger before submission to prevent "one fix for all" defense - If you have a bug that is in a multi-use platform, dont submit it to everything all at once, submit to one program get it paid, wait for a little bit and then submit it to another program and then wait for a little bit and then submit it to another program, to make sure they're not doing anything nefarious like sharing your attack string among thier customer.
- Revisit old bugs for bypass

### influence
- sometimes you may need to burn a submission to ask a question, like if you found some out of scope bugs
- has to be worded carefully

# What i learnt?
Start of the day was really great as i watch that starting vid, it gave a lot of insight. 
Then during the day, learnt a little bit more about flipkart, and how it operates, Currently it is taking a lot of time to learn about a particular application, but i feel, its absolutely okay, as I am just learning. And over time, this skill is only going to improve, and i will be able to learn about the application in hours.
And top hackers also suggest to learn about all of the application very deeply, that way you will be hacking when not actively hacking, meaning something may click off and you may even be able to chain serious vulnerabilities.
So now, I will be spending more days/weeks to learn about the application and also learn how to explore a particular application.

And, right now, I am not just exploring the application to understand them but also gathering some useful knowledge, like i got to know about CSP, CDN , and tomorrow most likely i will be reading about commerce graph, that flipkart uses to connect users, recommendations when their preference of shopping changes, etc.
Its tough, but I am learning a lot and enjoying :)

And then finally revisited ODIN's css inline and block, and then covered a little bit about flexbox.

It was a great day, i feel, but it could have even better if i didn't slept 3.5 hrs in afternoon, and didn't scrolled shorts for an hour after dinner.
But still, i would rate this 3/3 as i don't have much of guilt.
