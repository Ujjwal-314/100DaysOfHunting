# Day 1

## What i did (with timing)
Woke up at 6:00 with 6 hours of sleep.
- 6:00-8:00 - freshen up, exercise, breakfast
- 8:00-10:00 - portswigger password-based authentication
- 10:45-1:00 - shallow work, same as above
- 2:30-4:30 - same as above
-8:00-9:30 - same as above

- effective time spent: 8:30 hr

Today i only studied portswigger-password-based authentication and its related stuff.
Overall i would rate this day as "average"

## What i learnt
I learnt about bypassing password based authentication.
First step is checking for different responses.
Then trying to check with subtly different responses through length, status codes, response received(or response timing), grep extract for error responses, and analysing other relavant stuff.
Also, if you IP gets blocked, check if the server acceps X-Forwarded-For header, if it does, use it to bypass IP based protection.

Keep poking around with whatever clue you're getting, dont think of perfect plan or steps of action to perform because you are not going to get that as a learner, and while exploring and poking around you may find something or get an idea as to what to do. In, short keep experimenting...
