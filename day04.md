# What I did?

Woke up at 6:30 with 7 hours of sleep.
6:30 - 9:30 - freshen up, breakfast, (no exercise), scrolled yt for 1.5 hr. It is making me upset everyday, and i have to do something to prevent this. On almost everyday, i feel this urge and waste my precious time, so what is the root cause?
Keeping phone handy when not necessary - Keeping phone with yourself all the time, so when you are feeling a little bored, you take out this evil thing, and start wasting time. Honestly, I can sit for hours and concentrate but only when nothing is disturbing me. So what is the solution?
	- Dont keep phone with yourself all the time, only do necessary things on phone. Dont always try to sitmulate yourself, keep yourself free when possible.
	- Keep the password long, and disable biometric unlock.
	- In morning, dont touch phone before doing all chores.
	- Delete all the apps that are not necessary and can be done on desktop. like yt, others.

- 10:00-2:30 - flipkart explore, leant http history, and about CSP, CDN with around 30 mins break.
- 2:30 -3:05 - continued CDN
- 4:10 -4:40 - continued CDN, CSP 
- 4:40 -7:00 - teach, walk.
- 7:00 - 7:30 - contd. CSP
- 8:00 -10:00 -ODIN inline vs block with 30 minute other session on burp 
- 10:30-11:30 - inline vs block contd

Overall, the day was satisfactory, i would rate 3/3, my idea of rating a day is how much i have worked and if i am satisfied or not, i rather dont see the outcome of the day as it depends on the task, its complexity and my previous knowledge.

# What i learnt?

When i came across CSP told by grok when i gave him a request/response from flipkart, I read few articles on CSP, CDN and other related stuff.
Then i also revisited CSS inline vs block on ODIN Project, and solved few exercises.

# Tomorrow's plan

- First few hours trying to understand more about that web application.
- Then I will be start to learn XSS from portswigger, as i feel it would be really difficult to find authentication/access control vulnerabilities on this web application(its just my opinion and not any hardcore truth), and anyhow i have to learn that today or later.

- And finally, I will continue to solve the last exercise on inline & block exercise, and add a little bit of css in odin-recipes project on github.

# Edit1:
After completing my studies at 12:00 yesterday, i was about to go to sleep, but i thought of installing instagram, and see few updates, and opened reels, and 1.5 hrs passed like a snap.
Now i feel like constantly trying to stop this, wont help, rather i have to improve my work ethich, and it will automatically improve that, atleast I hope so.
I am sharing all this, just to be really honest with myself, and properly accountable, and not lying anywhere.
