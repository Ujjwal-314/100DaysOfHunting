# What i did?

I woke up at 7 with 7 hours of sleep, actually last hour just procrastinating which i regret. 
- 7:00-9:00 - freshen up, few pushups, breakfast 
 now i feel it is too much time early in the morning where it can be spent doing something worthwhile. So from now on, i will cut it to around 1:30 hrs to do all the morning chores. And, dont pick up the phone before doing all the chores as it wastes early hours.
- 9:00-11:00 - scrolled shorts
 i was feeling guilty but still kept doing, it is moving me away from my goals. Solution: Dont entertain yt or anything on phone, when you are free, be really free(dont start using phone), so that your brain can rest and enerzised for next learning or work session. Keep the password long, and disable biometric unlock.
12:30-2:00 - bash scripting
2:30 -4:30 - exploiting flawed brute force protection
8:00 -8:30 - burp docs on macro

I am not at all satisfied with this day, i would rate this day 1/3 i.e bad.
Will try to make sure these dont happen again tommorow.
Effective time spent: 4 hr

# What i learnt?
not much, just revisited ip based brute-force protection, little bit of bash scripting, and little burp docs on macro.

# Tomorrow's plan
from tomorrow, day 3, 14 apr, i will spend time on all 3 aspects .
1. Hunting on real web application, i might not find something for weeks/months but that how you get a hold on it.
2. Studying real vulnerabilities from web-security academy and maybe other resources like pentester lab, or other ctfs/labs.
3. Sharpening the axe by learning web dev from ODIN project, and other stuff like learning bash scripting, HTTP from MDN, should be done in this timeframe.

the time would not be strictly equal, all will be around 4 hours, some little less, some little more depending upon the situtation. In morning, start with hunting, taking notes, writing questions that you might get while testing/hunting. Then learn about the vulnerabilities, and doing labs, try to tinker in the lab instead of trying to find the solution as soon as possible. Then in the evening do ODIN Project and other things that you may have planned.
