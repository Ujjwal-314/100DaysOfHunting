# 100DaysOfHunting
In this repo, I will document my next 100 days(from 14apr - 22july '25) of learning and doing bug hunting.
Today(13th apr 2025), I am starting 100 days of learning and doing bug hunting, here i will be documenting what i did related to bug hunting for the next 100 days(22 july).
### What is this for?
I am currently a high school student, learning and doing a little bit of bug hunting. I feel I am not very consistent with learning and doing this. 
So i have decided that for the next 100 days, i.e 14 apr - 22 july 2025, i will be learning and doing bug hunting 7 days a week.
Its not necessarily going to stop exactly at 22july, I may even continue this after that timeline, but 22july is the minimum timeline that I will follow anyhow.
#### Consistency
Simultaneouly, I will also be doing ODIN project, and for few days I will have to appear for my high-school exams.
So, I will not have lot of hours everyday under my belt, but still to continue this series, i will spend minimum of 1 hr everyday either for learning or doing bug hunting. Under all circumstances(including when i am ill or went somewhere). 

### What will I be doing?
Mainly learning and doing bug hunting, and simultaneously ODIN project for few hours.

### Who is this for?
This may not be useful for you(if you're reading this), I am mainly documenting this for my accountibility. 
And if I fuck somewhere, i will not hesitate to put it out there.
If you are still interested, you can welcome.
Again, reading this will not make you a better hacker.
So, spend you precious time carefully.

### Outcome
I am doing this challenge to uplift my skills, At the end of this series, I should be able to find atleast 2 medium-high bugs at the end of this timeline.

### Comment after 22 july
Day is still to come, will update this when the time comes :)
