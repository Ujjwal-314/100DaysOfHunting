# What i learnt?

just explored the flipkart and made some notes on it.

# How was the day?

Early on, it was nice, but after coming back from taking class, not any significant. 
I will work on this, and try to make sure, this wont happen. 

I would rate this avaerage, 2/3.
Today i was not able to spend time on ODIN, and most likely from tomorrow onwards, i will do bash scripting in the timeframe of ODIN as i need to script a lot during the bug hunt process and i dont want to heavily rely on AI for all my work , as i feel that doing so i will become less competent which i dont want.
